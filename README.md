# Basilisque - Common Build

## Overview
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/badge/NuGet-latest-blue.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Basilisque.CommonBuild)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%20License%202.0-red.svg)](LICENSE.txt)  
This repository provides __optional__ common build configuration for projects that use the Basilisque framework. But it also can be used without Basilique.  
So if you like the contained configuration feel free to use it, otherwise simply don't.

## Description
This project doesn't contain any assemblies that will be deployed with the target project. Instead it only contains build time configuration (.props/.targets-files) to provide a common basic set of configuration to all target projects.

### Usage
Install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Basilisque.CommonBuild)  
This will automatically include the contained .props and .targets files in the build.

### Conventions
The configuration is based on conventions regarding the names of the target projects. _(The folder structure of the solution is irrelevant.)_

>_<sup>Containing automated tests. In this case for the MyProject.DataAccess-project<sup>_

Obviously not all applications need all of those project types. So e.g. if you don't need data access, then just do not create a project named like it. But if you do need data access, then let the project name end with _.DataAccess_. That is the intention behind the configuration in this repository.

### Provided Configuration
